Data Products Project

This project contains the data and analysis for the week 4 project of the Data Products module on Coursera.

The idea is to produce a shiny app based on any data set we choose.  This project is going to be based around traffic journey information in the cit of Bristol.


Data Capture
------------

The data directory contains a large CSV file downloaded from:

https://opendata.bristol.gov.uk/Mobility/Historic-journey-times/jdq4-bmr7

Note that the dataframe is updated every ten minutes.  This project will just use a static set, but a future project will sample new data every day.

The raw dataframe is called Historic.journey.times aand is cached because it takes a while to process the CSV. However, it is deleted from the environment after the initial processing.

A dataframe called journeys is used instead in the script.  This contains the raw data and some additional columns useful in the analysis.  This is also cached for speed.

There are a number of errors in the data which are fixed before caching the journeys object(see munge processing files).  This uses some additional information provided by Bristol CC (stored in a seperate directory).

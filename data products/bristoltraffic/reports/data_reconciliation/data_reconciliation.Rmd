```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Set keep_raw_data to be TRUE in the custom config file before running this script
# It assumes that Historic.journey.times has not been deleted

```

## Intro

This report reconciles and analyses where rows were not included from the raw data in the **journeys** data frame used for subsequent analysis.  Columns are not looked at because they are simply additions or substractions.

Basic stats about the raw data and the processed **journeys** data sets:

```{r basicinfo}

raw_data_rows <- nrow(Historic.journey.times)
journeys_rows <- nrow(journeys)
difference <- raw_data_rows -  journeys_rows

```

Raw data rows:  `r raw_data_rows`
journeys rows:  `r journeys_rows`
Difference to reconcile:  `r difference`

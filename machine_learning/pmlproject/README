Machine Learning Project
========================

This is the project directory for the Coursera Machine Learning project (week 4)

The data is specified in the data directory as a url.  It is cached straightaway in the munge script so that it can be loaded fast every time load.project() is run.

The preprocessing of the data sets takes place in:
        01-A.R
        
There are 2 analysis files

        eda.R   -       an early script exploring the data.  Most of the ideas here
                        ended up in 01-A.R, so this is not very relevant
                        
        model.R -       The random forest model is developed and the answers derived
                        to submit to the automated quiz
                        
Note:

The model.R file uses parallel processing to speed up the random forest (4 cores on my machine).  When package dplyr is loaded (like in eda.R) the combine method is masked and it screws up the parallel processing (the foreach function has a combine function to put together the model from each of the cores)

If dplyr is needed, it'll have to be unloaded before the model.R file runs.

This was a very tricky problem to figure out which I only discovered by accident

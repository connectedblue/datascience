Machine Learning Project
========================

This is the project directory for the Coursera Machine Learning project (week 4)

The data is specified in the data directory as a url.  It is cached straightaway in the munge script so that it can be loaded fast every time load.project() is run.

The preprocessing of the data sets takes place in:
        01-A.R
        
There are 4 analysis files

eda.R             -     an early script exploring the data.  Most of the ideas here
                        ended up in 01-A.R, so this is not very relevant
                        
rf-model-manual.R -    The random forest model is developed and the answers derived
                       to submit to the automated quiz.  Used manual calls to the 
                       method and the whole training set

rf-model-caret.R  -    The random forest model is developed and the answers derived
                       to submit to the automated quiz.  Used the train command and 
                       5-fold cross validation to derive a model

tree-model.R      -    A model using rpart is developed (terrible performance)

The two rf-model files produce predictions for the testing set which are identical.  The project asks for cross validation, so the results from the caret model will be used (takes longer to run than the manual) 

Note:

The rf-model.R file uses parallel processing to speed up the random forest (4 cores on my machine).  When package dplyr is loaded (like in eda.R) the combine method is masked and it screws up the parallel processing (the foreach function has a combine function to put together the model from each of the cores)

If dplyr is needed, it'll have to be unloaded before the model.R file runs.

This was a very tricky problem to figure out which I only discovered by accident

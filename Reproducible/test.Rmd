This is a test of the markdown capability

* Bullets go
* one after the
* other

Later on, we'll be able to add in code.



```{r, echo=FALSE, results="hide"}
`
opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
# First load the datasets, but don't show this code
library(datasets)
data<-airquality
```

The airquality dataset is loaded into a variable called data so we can see it.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(data)
```

The first value of Ozone is `r data$Ozone[1]`.  Now we want to see how ozone varies by month:

```{r ozoneByMonth, echo=FALSE}
plot(data$Month, data$Ozone, pch=19)
```

The first few values of the data table are:

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(head(data)), type="html")
```

This is a prettier version of the table

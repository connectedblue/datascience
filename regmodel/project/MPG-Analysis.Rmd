# Executive Summary

Motor Trend magazine have requested an analysis of the relationship between a set of car variables and the predicted miles per gallon (MPG). The following questions are of particular interest:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

The analysis is based on a data set of a collection of cars, summarised in the appendix.

We conclude that manual transmission is better for MPG, especially when considered
